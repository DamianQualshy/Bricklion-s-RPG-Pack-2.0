# Bricklion's RPG Pack
[Original Minecraft Forum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/389061-16x17-bricklions-rpg-pack-v111/)

[Planet Minecraft project page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/bricklion-s-rpg-pack-2-0/)

Branches on this repo are different versions of the pack that I could find, alongside the ones I made myself.

## 1.21.1
As it is in [Pack Format 34](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format) (what a jump, eh?), it will work properly in versions 24w21a – 1.21.1 or 1.21 – 1.21.1

It is also recommended to use Programmer Art alongside this texturepack.

# Credits
Obviously for Bricklion for creating the original pack and Nidrax for the 1.2.3 update.
