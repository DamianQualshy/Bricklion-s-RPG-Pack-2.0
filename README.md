# Bricklion's RPG Pack
[Original Minecraft Forum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/389061-16x17-bricklions-rpg-pack-v111/)

[Planet Minecraft project page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/bricklion-s-rpg-pack-2-0/)

Branches on this repo are different versions of the pack that I could find, alongside the ones I made myself.

## 1.12.2
As it is in [Pack Format 3](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format), it will work properly in versions 16w32a – 17w47b 	or 1.11 – 1.12.2

# Credits
Obviously for Bricklion for creating the original pack and Nidrax for the 1.2.3 update.
