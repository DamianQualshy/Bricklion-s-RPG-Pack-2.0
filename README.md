# Bricklion's RPG Pack
Original forum thread: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/389061-16x17-bricklions-rpg-pack-v111/

Branches on this repo are different versions of the pack that I could find, alongside the ones I made myself.

# Credits
Obviously for Bricklion for creating the pack and Nidrax for the 1.2.3 pack.

But also for people who created tools that really helped me out here:
