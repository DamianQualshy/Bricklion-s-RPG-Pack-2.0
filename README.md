# Bricklion's RPG Pack
[Original Minecraft Forum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/389061-16x17-bricklions-rpg-pack-v111/)

[Planet Minecraft project page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/bricklion-s-rpg-pack-2-0/)

Branches on this repo are different versions of the pack that I could find, alongside the ones I made myself.

## Releases
For specific versions of the packs, please check [Releases](https://github.com/DamianQualshy/Bricklion-s-RPG-Pack-2.0/releases).

The pack for now supports these versions:
**v1.1.1** | up to b1.7.3
**v1.2.3** | up to 1.2.3
**v1.7.10** | 1.6.1 - 1.7.10
**v1.12.2** | 1.11 - 1.12.2
**v1.16.5** | 1.16.2 - 1.16.5
**v1.18.2** | 1.18 â€“ 1.18.2

If you wonder why the packs have such specific game versions assigned to them, I encourage you to check Minecraft Wiki articles about [Pack Format](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format) and [Resource Packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack).

# Gallery
You should obviously check the Planet Minecraft page for that, but I'll link them here anyway. The top one will always contain latest screenshots, I'm leaving the older images just for comparison.
