# Bricklion's RPG Pack
[Original Minecraft Forum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/389061-16x17-bricklions-rpg-pack-v111/)

[Planet Minecraft project page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/bricklion-s-rpg-pack-2-0/)

Branches on this repo are different versions of the pack that I could find, alongside the ones I made myself.

## 1.7.3
As it is an old-format Texture Pack, it will work properly up to version b1.7.3. You can technically still use it up to 13w23b or 1.5.2, but the new blocks (and possibly items) will be missing their textures.

# Credits
Obviously for Bricklion for creating the original pack and Nidrax for the 1.2.3 update.
